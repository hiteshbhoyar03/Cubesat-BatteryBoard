This is the CubeSat Battery Board designed to provide stable, rechargeable power to the system via regulated Li-ion cell management. Built around high-efficiency battery charging ICs and ideal diode power path controllers, this board ensures safe and reliable power delivery to the Electrical Power System (EPS) and other subsystems.

It handles solar power input, charging, and provides regulated power output to the Electrical Power System (EPS) through a IPS1-105-01-L-D interface.

>  This board is part of a modular, learning-focused CubeSat design aimed at developing embedded hardware skills in space-grade power management.
